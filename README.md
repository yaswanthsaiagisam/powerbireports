# **Power BI Report: Analysis of Total Banks in the U.S.**

This repository contains a Power BI report analyzing the dataset of banks across different states in the U.S., including data on bank failures, closures, and overall activity by state, bank name, and time period.

## **Project Overview**

This project utilizes Power BI to create a comprehensive report on banks in the United States, focusing on various insights such as:
- **Geographical distribution** of banks by state.
- **Bank closures over time**, by year and month.
- **Top states with the most bank failures.**
- **Key banks** that have shown the most activity.

The analysis can help stakeholders understand patterns in the banking sector, including periods of economic downturns, regional trends, and bank closures.

## **Dataset**

- The dataset used contains details of banks, their states, closing dates, and names. 
- The dataset has been processed and visualized using **Power BI** to present key insights.

### **Key Attributes in the Dataset:**
- **State**: The U.S. state where the bank is located.
- **Closing Date**: The date when the bank was closed or failed.
- **Bank Name**: The name of the bank.

## **Visualizations**

The report includes several important visualizations:

1. **Map of Total Banks by State**:
   - Displays the geographical distribution of banks across the U.S.
   - Color-coded by state to show where most bank activity or closures have occurred.

2. **Top States by Total Banks**:
   - A bar chart of states with the highest number of banks.
   - Georgia, Florida, and Illinois are identified as states with the most bank activity.

3. **Bank Name Distribution**:
   - Shows the sum of bank names and highlights the most frequent banks that appear in the dataset.

4. **Count of Banks by Month**:
   - A bar chart displaying the monthly trends in bank closures and activity, with peaks in summer months like July.

5. **Total Banks by Closing Date**:
   - A timeline of bank closures by state and year, providing historical context for periods of financial instability.

## **Insights and Key Takeaways**

- **Regional Analysis**: Georgia, Florida, and Illinois are identified as the states with the highest number of failed or closed banks, suggesting regional disparities in economic or banking conditions.
- **Monthly Trends**: Bank closures tend to spike during certain months, with a noticeable peak in July.
- **Timeline of Closures**: The timeline view shows key periods where bank closures were concentrated, potentially tied to broader economic trends or crises.
